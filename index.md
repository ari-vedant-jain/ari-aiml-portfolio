# **Ari Jain — AI/ML Portfolio**

**AI Specialist • RAG & Multi-Agent Architectures • AI Security & LLM Red Teaming • Distributed ML & MLOps**

I design and ship production-grade AI systems for enterprises… from scalable RAG and multi-agent workflows to AI security, red teaming, and distributed training on cloud accelerators. 

My background spans:
- **AWS** – Led global initiatives for Amazon SageMaker Human-in-the-Loop ML and 2P models, plus Ray + AWS accelerator integrations highlighted at Ray Summit ’23.
- **Protect AI** – Building AI security capabilities for LLMs and gen-AI workloads: automated red teaming, guardrails, and endpoint scanning for platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Databricks Mosaic AI.
- **Public technical writing** – 20+ articles spanning RAG, multi-agent systems, AI security, prompt-injection testing, and distributed ML infrastructure.

## 🛡 AI Security & Red Teaming

I focus heavily on the safety and robustness side of AI:

- LLM red-teaming and automated adversarial testing  
- Prompt-injection detection and remediation  
- Guardrails for hallucination mitigation and policy enforcement  
- Secure deployment patterns on Amazon Bedrock, Databricks Mosaic AI, and other enterprise platforms
