# **Ari Vedant Jain — AI/ML Portfolio**

**AI Technologist • Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems • AI Security & LLM Red Teaming**

> My name is Vedant Jain, but I prefer to go by **Ari**.

I specialize in building **agentic AI systems** for enterprises—from autonomous multi-agent workflows and RAG architectures to AI security, red teaming, and production-grade LLM deployments.

## 💼 Experience

- **Protect AI** – Building AI security capabilities for LLMs and gen-AI workloads: automated red teaming, guardrails, and endpoint scanning for platforms like Amazon Bedrock and Databricks Mosaic AI.

- **AWS** – Led global initiatives for Amazon SageMaker Human-in-the-Loop ML and 2P models, plus Ray + AWS accelerator integrations highlighted at Ray Summit '23.

- **Databricks** – Worked on agentic AI solutions and MLOps integrations for enterprise customers deploying multi-agent systems on Databricks platform.

- **Cloudera** – Contributed to AI/ML platform capabilities and enterprise data science workflows for large-scale deployments.

- **Public technical writing** – 20+ articles spanning agentic AI, RAG, multi-agent systems, AI security, prompt-injection testing, and distributed ML infrastructure.

## 🛡 AI Security & Red Teaming

I focus heavily on the safety and robustness side of AI:

- LLM red-teaming and automated adversarial testing
- Prompt-injection detection and remediation
- Guardrails for hallucination mitigation and policy enforcement
- Secure deployment patterns on Amazon Bedrock, Databricks Mosaic AI, and other enterprise platforms
