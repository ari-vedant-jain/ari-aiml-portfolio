## What I’m Looking For

I am interested in roles where I can combine:

- **Technical depth** in AI/ML and distributed systems  
- **Customer and partner engagement**  
- **AI security and governance**  
- **Mentoring and scaling AI adoption**

Examples:
- AI Specialist Solutions Architect  
- Partner Solutions Architect (AI / GenAI / AI Security)
