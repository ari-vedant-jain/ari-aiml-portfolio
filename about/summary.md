# About Me

I am an AI/ML specialist with deep experience across the enterprise AI lifecycle… from data and model pipelines to RAG architectures, multi-agent systems, and AI security.

Over the past several years I have:

- **At AWS**
  - Led global initiatives for **Amazon SageMaker Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) ML** and **2P model integrations**.
  - Drove the technical integration of **Ray** with **AWS AI accelerators** (Trainium, Inferentia), work that was highlighted at **Ray Summit ’23**.
  - Authored multiple AWS blogs on built-in algorithms, distributed training, RAG, visual inspection, fraud detection, and data infrastructure using SageMaker, EMR, Delta Lake, and JumpStart.

- **At Protect AI**
  - Focused on **AI security for LLMs and gen-AI workloads**.
  - Built automated red-teaming pipelines using **Protect AI Recon** across infrastructures like **Amazon Bedrock** and **Databricks Mosaic AI Model Serving**.
  - Designed and implemented **guardrails** for models like **DeepSeek-R1**, with an emphasis on prompt-injection defense, hallucination mitigation, and policy-driven safety.

- **In the community**
  - Published articles on **RAG**, **multi-agent systems**, **prompt-injection testing**, **MCTS-based answer selection**, and **rewards-based in-context learning**.
  - Created practical frameworks for **LLM vulnerability remediation** and **test-driven prompt security**.

## What I’m Looking For

I am interested in roles where I can combine:

- **Technical depth** in AI/ML and distributed systems  
- **Customer and partner engagement**  
- **AI security and governance**  
- **Mentoring and scaling AI adoption**

Examples:
- AI Specialist Solutions Architect  
- Partner Solutions Architect (AI / GenAI / AI Security)  
- Solutions Architect leadership roles focused on AI adoption and mentoring other SAs  
- AI Security / Red-Teaming focused roles

I thrive in collaborative environments that value experimentation, knowledge sharing, and building trustworthy AI systems at scale.
