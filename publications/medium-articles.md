# Medium Articles – RAG, Agents & AI Security

A selection of my Medium articles focused on RAG systems, agentic architectures, and AI security:

1. **Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Multi-Agent Intelligence and Security**  
2. **Simple Techniques for Common LLM Vulnerabilities Remediation**  
3. **Test-Driven Development for Prompt Injection Testing: Fail Fast, Learn, Iterate**  
4. **Mastering Retrieval Augmented Generation: Agentic RAG with Locally Running Llama3 and Google Search**  
5. **Taming the Trojan: A Guide to Combating Prompt Injection**  
6. **Improving Text Quality with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in Retrieval Augmented Generation**  
7. **Using Rewards-Based Mechanisms to Improve In-Context Learning in RAG** (GoPenAI)

These pieces explore:

- Multi-agent RAG orchestration  
- LLM vulnerabilities and security patterns  
- Test-driven AI security and prompt-injection resilience  
- Search-driven and reward-driven optimization of LLM behavior
