# AWS AI/ML Publications

A selection of AI/ML articles I have authored or co-authored on the AWS platform:

1. **Increase ML model performance and reduce training time using Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms with pre-trained models**  
2. **Building Reliable and Scalable Generative AI Infrastructure on AWS with Ray and Anyscale**  
3. **Mitigate hallucinations through Retrieval Augmented Generation using Pinecone vector database & Llama-2 from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart**  
4. **Visual inspection automation using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart**  
5. **Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning with Amazon SageMaker**  
6. **Load and transform data from Delta Lake using Amazon SageMaker Studio and Apache Spark**  
7. **Detect financial transaction fraud using a Graph Neural Network with Amazon SageMaker**  
8. **Building a more efficient data infrastructure for machine learning with Open Source using Delta Lake, Amazon SageMaker, and EMR**  
9. **Deploying Open Source LLM for RAG using Amazon SageMaker**

These posts cover themes like:

- Distributed model training  
- RAG architectures on SageMaker  
- Computer vision with JumpStart  
- Fraud detection with GNNs and traditional ML  
- Data pipelines for ML at scale using EMR, Spark, and Delta Lake
