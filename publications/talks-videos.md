## AI Security & Red Teaming

I regularly demo:

- Automated red-teaming flows using Protect AI Recon  
- Guardrail design and enforcement for LLMs  
- Secure deployment patterns on AWS and Databricks  

Where relevant, I connect these demos back to:

- The AWS and Protect AI blog posts listed in this portfolio  
- Medium articles on RAG, agents, and AI security
